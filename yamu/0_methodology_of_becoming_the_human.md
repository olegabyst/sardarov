# Methodology of becoming the Human.

Author don't take responsibility for methodologies and practical recomnedations described in this book. You can misinterpret them according to own experience, as result overreact, and damage yourself and people around. For this reason, it's better not even start to do things described in this book. Treat it like funny book, close it and forget everything you read here to not risk and create unrecoverable consequences. If you do something in wrong way, you can only aggravate the situation. So you can perceive this stuff like fancy story of demented kurd.

But there will be ones, who really understand this stuff, who feel that it's what he looking for all his life. That it's missing info what he need to transform from an idler into human, which start to create a really interesting life. There will be small number of such people, and they will immediatly catch ideas from this book. They should not hurry up, and gradually do experiments on themselves, according to recomendations described in this book.  For sure, in the process there some nuances appear, and as result you will have your own ideas how you can do variations(go harder) in your life.

I do not recommend forget about safety precautions, for reason to not damage yourself if you overreact. Before put this book in the Web, I gave to read this book to 5 different people, which have different age and life experience to understand how much dangerous the stuff in this book. According to received feedback, I make some recomendations less radical. Recomendations intentionally described in general way, since people which has no "receiver"(ability to analyze own behavior and how this behavior was formed, and understand the message which autor wants spread around the world in this book) can apply my methodology in stupid way, and damage yourself. People which has "receiver" understand everything even without details. There is many practical recomendations in this book, you can just take them and apply in your life. Then you will see on your own experience how will change the way you think and you will feel strong desire to act and achieve the goals, instead of just stagnate and think about "global problems, eternal values, meaning of life".

You can think that this book gives some fabricated recommendations, which cannot help you in real life, but just involve you in some adventure. Nothing of the kind, I rethought every recomendation many times, and apply 90% of my recomendations in own life, more over do it without any plan, just because during my life I often needed overcome obstacles. Before you can imporve your life, you need your life become worse, and after that your brain start think in correct way, you become more pragmatic, naivity disapear, as well as baseless optimism and fairy images from films

After overcoming every obstacle that described in this book, You start to be realistic, pragmatic and adequate(to your environment) person, and after that you cannot continue to fool yourself. You will see how much people you know are naive, unadapted to life and behaves like a gopher. They doesn't have enought life experience and don't understend how things work. Because everyone live in it's own hedged microworld, which safe and full of illusions, BECAUSE they live in peacuful environment wiht enought amount of resources. They cant go out of this microworld, put the goals and achieve them, because they can't perceive the world in the way how it really works, since doesn't interoperate with it in wide variety of ways.

The more "tasks"(my recommendations) you done, the more soon you start think in right direction.  Your mentality will transform, you start feel different emotions, you will look at yourself, your behavior and people around you from much more bigger amount of angles. You will reestimate the goals in your life, understand your gist, the bounds of your weakness and strength. You can't achive this understanding through reading books or watching films. You can't watch horror and think that now you understand what is a "fear". You should feel it on yourself.

I give you in this book really well-thought recomendations how probe your bounds in relatively safe
way.
